  npm -v
  ```

If there is no version, follow this steps:

- Visit the Node.js website.

## Steps

1. **Clone the Project Repository**

   Clone the existing React project repository to your local machine using Git. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project and run the following command:

   ```bash
      https://github.com/OlexandraKorol/OlexandraKorol.github.io.git
   ```


2. **Open the repository**

   Once the repository is cloned, open it in the text editor


3. **Install Dependencies**

   Use npm to install the project dependencies. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command will install all the required packages and dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.

4. **Start the Development Server**

   To start the development server and run the React app locally, run:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command will launch your default web browser and open the React app. You can now view and interact with the app locally.
